# Cryptography
 Collection of different functions to decode and encode with some known coding methods
 - all functions are only for text-examples that are written in capslock
 - for some methods there are brute-force functions for others not
 - the given examples are from the lecture "Kryptographie und Komplexit√§t" from Prof. Dr. Christoph Kreitz
